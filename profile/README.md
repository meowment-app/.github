### Meowment is a new Fediverse social network, compatible with ActivityPub, to share more than just microblogging posts with your friends.

I'm creating a self-hostable and federated social network to bring your friends together in a single place, where you can do a lot more than microblogging. 
- What about sharing your photos in high quality with the world?
- What about sharing your latest DJ set without relying on another service?
- What if you want to create more permanent posts?
- What if you want to gather all your posts with a common theme in a single place, like your analog pictures? Your trip media? Your best jokes?

### I want to create a space on the Fediverse to share what you love in a way your content deserves to be highlighted.

### The application will be web-only at first, and I hope to create native apps as soon as I can, or at least, provide an API so others can build their own clients.
